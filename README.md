Inspired by a video on a YouTube channel, I created my own version of a finance control application. It's not fully completed yet, but it currently meets my needs.

Languages and Specifications Used:
    Python: The main programming language used to develop the application.

Dash Framework: 
    Used for creating the web application's front end.

Frontend Technologies:
    HTML: Used for structuring the layout and elements of the web application.
    CSS: Applied through Bootstrap and inline styles for consistent and responsive design.
    JavaScript: Implicitly used through Dash for interactive features and callbacks.
Data Storage and Manipulation:
    CSV Files: Used to save and load data using pandas DataFrames.
